    [INFORMATION]
    Fonts primarily functions by replacing player text with Unicode equivalents.

    This plugin comes pre-packaged with 4 fonts by default:
      - circled
      - italic
      - mono
      - smallcaps

    You may add more fonts by adding more yml files to the "Fonts/fonts" folder, or the folder this file is in.
    The way the names are determined in-game is by the name of the file, for example:
    circled.yml -> a font named "circled" in-game.

    As there are various Unicode text styles, and Minecraft's support of them being inconsistent,
    I decided to limit the amount of fonts prepackaged. The format for a font file can be seen
    in any of the packaged fonts. As entering the information for the font can be tedious, I suggest
    providing ChatGPT with an example of how the file is formatted, then asking it to generate a file
    representing the Unicode font you want to add.

    Custom Fonts using custom texture packs are possible, however, support for them is currently limited with
    this plugin. In a future update, I will add more support. If you are interested in trying to use a custom font,
    contact me either by email (wiicart@pedestriamc.com), or on Discord (@wiicart).
